audio text taken from a TED interview

I basically scribbled down what the HTML should be,
hypertext protocol, HTTP.
the idea of URLs, names for things
that run on HTTP.
I wrote the code and put it there

Why did I do this?

Well, it was just a frustration.
I was frustrated. I work as a software engineer
in this huge laboratory,
with lots of people from all over.
They brought all kinds of computers.
they had all kinds of data in different formats.
a whole different way of documenting.
and then in all this diversity,
to figure out how to build something
without a little of this a little of that,
with everything I saw I had to connect different machines,
I had to learn how to run new programs,
I looked for information in different formats
and they were all incompatible.
it was very frustrating.
the frustration was due to the infinite possibilities.
In fact, on all these discs there were documents
So if you imagine all this
being part of something much larger, a virtual document system,
for example on the internet
then life would be easier
well when you have an idea like that it gives you chills
even when no one reads what you write.
